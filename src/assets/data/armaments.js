      descriptionFlavour: '\"Ominous piercing sword with a winding blade. Carried by the noble servants of the Lord of Blood.\"',
      descriptionParagraphs: [`An elegant weapon for the more discerning blood-drunk sadist, this heavy thrusting sword is a contender for my favourite weapon in the game. 
        This weapon starts strong with a C scaling in dex and a B scaling in arcane, meaning you can pump arcane to not only boost base damage but also take full advantage of the 
        blood loss buildup afforded by the winding corkscrew blade.`,
        `So we have a strong heavy thrusting sword moveset, combine that with high arcane damage scaling and innate blood loss which on a full arcane build
        will afford us insane burst damage. We haven't even talked about the best part yet; Dynast's Finesse. Everyone loves weapon arts where you press L2 to blow
        everything up; they're simple and they work. The Bloody Helice thinks this is all quite unsophisticated and instead has a three-part weapon art. Starting with a 
        elegant backwards manoeuver which crucially has iframes similar to bloodhounds step. Optionally you can follow this up with a quick forwards lunge which hits hard
        and does heavy stance damage and then again follow up with a double swipe to close out the combo if you so please.`, 
        `Since we are an arcane-heavy build we can also spec a little into faith and get some of the dragon communion and blood incantations for our offhand. I keep Bloodboon and Swarm of Flies as my ranged option when required
        but the real money shot is the dragon communion spells, mainly Dragonmaw and Dragonclaw. Dragonclaw has incredible crowd control potential and Dragonmaw does obscene damage. Nothing is more disrespectful than deftly avoiding a boss Matrix-style and then stance breaking them with Dynast\'s Finesse,
        critting them and as they wake up you greet them with a massive dragon head about bite their head off.`,
        `This is so powerful just from how you have control over
        every part of the combo. If you think the enemy is going to follow up then after each manoeuver you can end the combo there. You can even unlock the camera
        before you do the iframe dodge to direct it in any direction if you want to be really techy. Overall this weapon can be manipulated to pull off some awesome techs and is an extremely strong choice.`],

      descriptionFlavour: 'A long-hafted golden axe wielded by the Death Knight. Bears a representation of a decayed golden ring. Crackles with lightning, the power of the capital\'s ancient dragon cult',
      descriptionParagraphs: [`We might not have gotten Godwyn in the DLC but we got his Death Knights: undead edgelords who use lightning lavishly. You pinch this greataxe when you defeat one of them
        and rest assured it was worth seeking out. As if lightning builds needed to be any more powerful; this boasts a B scaling in strength and a D in faith but the split lightning damage will ensure 
        your faith investment won\'t go amiss and begets a nice even stat split between strength and faith.`,
        `This faith is crucial as it introduces lightning incantations into this build which are some of the strongest in the game. The new Knight\'s Lightning Spear is our bread and butter spell with its ferocious damage,
        sweet delayed attacks and dazzling finesse. Our second main incantation is Ancient Dragon\'s Lightning Strike which is quite situational. It\'s slow to come out and has a tendency to miss small targets but against large enemies the damage is ludicrous.
        I accidentally shredded half of Putrescent Knight\'s health by giving him a taste of this. Put on any other spells that suit you
        like any Crucible ones (Horns is hard to say no to, flipping humanoids like a pancake) to give your build some real utility!`,
        `Of course we can\'t forget the star of the show which is the axe. The greataxe moveset is beautiful in it\'s simplicity: overhead smash. It also features probably the coolest skill of any weapon which is Blinkbolt.
        It\'s actually very similar to Bloody Helice in that the first press is a manoeuver with built-in iframes. Surge forwards, vanishing into a bolt of electricity to deliver you a few feet forward and poise you for an epic follow-up where you
        leap up and bring the axe down in a blast of lightning. First of all, this is awesome. Second of all it gives you exactly the kind of tech potential as Bloody Helice and introduces a whole new way to avoid attacks. It\'s slightly different in that you go forwards instead of back and
        you do seem to have less iframes. Such is the price you pay for looking cool.`,
        `Overall I would argue the skill isn\'t quite as strong as Dynasts Finesse but its still in immensely strong skill and the build is afforded much more synergy 
        with its incantations in a way that the dragon ones don\'t, such as benefitting from the lightning scorpion charm. As such you can also customise what you want to focus on. If you love Blinkbolt then put on Shard of Alexander
        but I chose to focus on supplementing my weapon with my incantations to get off that sweet Ancient Dragon\'s Lightning Strike so I opted for Flock\'s Canvas Talisman.`
