            `The king of the hill, the battle axe is my most used weapon in the game by a long shot. It's just brutal: with it's defining feature being its ability to dish out
            damage in abundance in as short a time as possible. It owes this to it's deceptively fast swing speed which makes it feel very natural to use, and the crushing blows make it rewarding too.`,
            `Like any weapon in Chivalry 2 it doesn't come without drawbacks. It is quite a short-range weapon which can easily be outspaced by longer weapons, meaning you need to play aggressively and get 
            into the thick of it to overwhelm your enemy. Many a time has a battle axe player whiffed his swing completely only to get smacked afterwards, which is where a feint might come in handy to help delay your strike until they're in range. 
            This playstyle is why it suits me so well: you can focus on your own technique and embrace the natural rhythm of combat, trusting your weapon to do it's part. And believe me, it will.`

            `Many players know this nasty little thing as the 'gamble stick', a reputation which certainly isn't unfounded. It's earned this name because of how easily you can break the normal flow of combat and 'gamble' on a free hit.
            This is my second most used weapon and it is characterised by its rapid and relentless attack. It's fast to swing, and since it's a blunt weapon it combos extremely fast, allowing you to overwhelm your opponent with a flurry of hits before
            they can figure out what day of the week it is. The damage isn't bad either for a one-handed weapon, it soon adds up and even more so against knights with their weakness to blunt damage.`,
            `As with any one-handed weapon it shares a fairly short range, meaning you will have to really lean into the aggressive playstyle and overwhelm your enemy. This isn't an issue for me though as that's exactly the kind of playstyle i enjoy.
            If I'm in the mood for a one-handed weapon this monster is where my mind goes to first. For 1v1 fights as long as you stick to your opponent like glue you'll be hard pressed to find a more terrifying weapon.`
